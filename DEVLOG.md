### What I worked on:
- Implemented JSON marshaling/unmarshaling with structs for HTTP request handling
- Learned about Go's package organization and struct visibility rules
- Explored dependency injection patterns vs global state for logging
- Debugged issues with Go test caching affecting integration tests
- Set up HTTP handler for processing JSON POST requests

### Problems or blockers:
- Initially struggled with nil pointer dereference when trying to use logger as global variable before initialization
- Encountered confusion with Go test caching making it appear that server wasn't receiving requests

### Decisions made and why:
- **Struct Organization**: Decided to keep related structs in the same package rather than separate files, following Go's "organize by functionality, not by type" principle
- **Global Logger Access**: Chose to stick with global state for logging (controlled global) rather than full dependency injection, balancing convenience vs testability for infrastructure concerns like logging
- **JSON Handling**: Used Go's built-in `encoding/json` package with struct tags for clean serialization/deserialization
- **Testing Approach**: Learned to use `go test -count=1` or `go clean -testcache` to handle integration test caching issues

### What I learned:
- **Go Package System**: Files in the same package can access each other's exported types without imports, but both files must have identical package declarations. You cannot export structs from a test file.
- **io.Reader Interface**: How to convert marshaled JSON byte slices to `io.Reader` using `bytes.NewBuffer()` for HTTP requests
- **Dependency Injection Trade-offs**: Understood the tension between explicit dependencies (testable but verbose) vs global state (convenient but harder to test)
- **Go Test Caching**: How Go aggressively caches test results and why this can be confusing for integration tests that depend on external services

### Next steps:
- Expand on struct learning to include JSON tags
- Begin speccing out the struct for our job que messages that our server will
receive.

### What I worked on:
- Implemented a custom logger for the application that writes logs to a file
(`log.txt`) in the root directory

### Problems or blockers:
- None in the traditional sense, but the main challenge was figuring out how to
implement file-based logging in Go using idiomatic patterns

### Decisions made and why:
- Opted to roll my own file-based logger using Goâ€™s standard `log` and `os`
packages
- Decided to fail fast and exit the application (`log.Fatal`) if logger
initialization fails, to ensure visibility into startup issues and guarantee
that logging is available from the beginning
- Chose to write logs to a persistent file so I can track application flow,
debug issues more easily, and retain logs between sessions

### What I learned:
- How to use Go's `os.OpenFile` with flags like `os.O_CREATE`, `os.O_WRONLY`,
and `os.O_APPEND` to control how the log file is opened
- How Go uses octal notation (`0644`) for file permissions, and how to interpret
those permission bits
- The difference between `os.Executable()` and `os.Getwd()`:
  - `os.Executable()` points to the temporary binary path created by `go run .`
  - `os.Getwd()` returns the actual working directory, which is what I needed to
  place my log file at the expected location
- Basic architectural thinking around startup order, initialization, and the
importance of early failure in observability-critical subsystems like logging

### Next steps:
- Learn how to interact with my http server via my go application

### What I worked on:
- Plan an initialize project repo
- Add pre-commit hooks to prevent push to main
- Add PR template
- Add first implementation of http server

### Problems or blockers:
- none

### Decisions made and why:
- Prevent pushes to main to force me to create PR for all work

### What I learned:
- How to start a basic http server in Go 

### Next steps:
- Setup a custom logger that outputs to a system file
